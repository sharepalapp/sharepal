						<p>People are asking us: "How can I get more sales without paid advertising?&rdquo; &ldquo;Is there a way to work with micro bloggers?" This article is for you.</p>
						<h2>People buy from people</h2>
						<p>Whether you are a family business or brand that has an amazing story to tell, the human touch is very important. It enables a relationship between people and you can build and cultivate trust. People are more likely to trust advice from someone they know than from a company.</p>
						<p>People share experiences and these personal stories entertain and educate other potential customers about the amazing products, fantastic customer service, and the best deals. Your potential customers may think &ldquo;If it works for her, it might work for me too&rdquo;.</p>
						<h2>Use technology to serve people</h2>
						<p>Chatbots and AI can increase efficiency but at the cost of losing human interaction and trust. Have you ever felt valued or recognized when you had to prove to a robot that you are not a robot? The bottom line is that people are the real influencers.</p>
						<h2>Bloggers and micro-influencers</h2>
						<p>Bloggers and micro-influencers often attract and cultivate an active community. Beauty bloggers are at the front in creating hair and make-up trends. And they are a go-to source of information and tutorials. DIY&rsquo;ers on youtube &ldquo;makes you feel like you can do anything&rdquo;.&nbsp; Micro-bloggers are particularly active since they can talk to all their followers and have real interaction between followers as well.</p>
						<h2>Privacy regulations can drive up customer acquisition costs</h2>
						<p>Respecting privacy is increasingly legislated by regulators. In Europe through the GDRP, in the USA with the CONSENT Act and various other Consumer Rights Acts. The costs of leads and potential buyers may go up. Companies and brands have to find other ways to grow organically and long-term.</p>
						<h2>Partner with your existing customers</h2>
						<p>Your existing customers are expert salespeople. They went through all the phases of a purchase decision and chose your company above others.</p>
						<p>When they unbox your product, they often post on social media such as Instagram. These are the kind of use-cases that are authentic and many customers may know another potential customer. This provides a fantastic opportunity to partner with them. You can give new customers a referral link to your Shopify store that includes their username. As an incentive, you can give their friends a discount and your existing customer cashback. And with a referral link, they will have an incentive to keep on mentioning your company in future posts.</p>
						<h2>Save on advertising, partner with your customers</h2>
						<p>Advertising is one of the biggest costs for online stores. It typically is about 15-25% of online store expenses. Instead of spending this money at big tech companies, you can invest this in your users and grow organically.</p>
